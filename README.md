# pyhton-challenge

The current challenge contains two projects:

### PyBank
The "main.py" file iterates over the financial record of a company to return the overall results of the profit/losses of the entire period analyzed and creates a .txt file located in "analysis" directory.

The dataset used for this project is located in "resources" directory.

### PyPoll
The "main.py" file iterates over the voters registration of a town election and returns the winner candidate with the final count of votes gathered by each candidate. Finally it creates a txt file with the election results. The file is located in the "analysis" directory.

Due to the dataset size, this was not included within the project directory.

thanks!
